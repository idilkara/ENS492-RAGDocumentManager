# User Interface Features and example images

NOTE: we had to change some fatures of the software throughtout the process so there may be some inconsistencies in the ui based on the time we took the images but the key functionalities are still relevant to the documentation and the latest version. For example, we added LLM model selection and then removed it so some images has it some do not.
