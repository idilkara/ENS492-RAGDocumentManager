# RAG Implementation and LLM Strategies Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the technical implementation of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and Language Model (LLM) integration. The system is designed to provide context-aware responses by combining document retrieval with language model generation.

## Vector Store Implementation

### Embeddings
- **Model**: HuggingFaceEmbeddings
- **Configuration**:
  - Model Name: Specified in config as `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME_V2`
  - Device: CPU (configurable for GPU) since it is loaded in the backend, we assumed the backend server will be in a machine not necessarily with a GPU available for this computation.
  - Normalization: Enabled for better similarity matching

### Document Storage
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
  - Persistent storage for document embeddings
  - HTTP client implementation for distributed access
  - Configurable connection URL via CHROMADB_URL environment variable


- **Document Database**: MongoDB
  - Raw PDF document storage in binary format
  - Document metadata storage including:
    - Filename
    - Upload timestamp
    - Document ID
    - Custom metadata fields
  - Collections:
    - documents: Stores PDF files and metadata
    - users: User account information
    - sessions: Chat history and conversation context
  - Configurable via environment variables:
    - MONGO_URI for connection string
    - DB_NAME for database name
    - Collection names configurable through environment
  - GridFS: MongoDB's solution for storing and retrieving large files
    - Automatically splits files >16MB into chunks
    - Stores file metadata separately
    - Enables efficient streaming of large documents
    - Currently not in use as we store files directly in MongoDB collections

    - Sentence-level highlighting for precise context
    - Yellow highlight color (RGB: 1, 1, 0)
    - PDF optimization with garbage collection and compression
    - Automatic PDF repair for corrupted files using qpdf

### Source Management
- Tracks document sources:
  - MongoDB integration for document storage
  - Temporary file management system
  - Automatic cleanup of highlighted PDFs
- Maintains page numbers:
  - Page-level tracking for multi-page documents
  - Preserves original document structure
  - Handles page-specific highlighting

    - Automatic cleanup of expired files
    - Unique file naming using UUID
    - Error handling for file operations

### PDF Processing Pipeline
1. Document Retrieval:
   - Fetches original document from MongoDB
   - Creates temporary copy for processing
   - Validates document integrity

2. Highlighting Process:
   - Extracts text from PDF using PyMuPDF's fitz.Document() 
   - Cleans text by removing special characters and normalizing whitespace
   - Uses fitz.Page.search() to find text matches at sentence level
   - Adds highlights with page.add_highlight_annot() in yellow (RGB 1,1,0)
   - Optimizes PDF with garbage=4, deflate=True settings

3. Error Handling:
   - Uses qpdf to repair corrupted PDFs before processing
   - Falls back to original document if highlighting fails
   - Logs errors with traceback for debugging
   - Continues processing remaining pages if single page fails

4. File Management:
   - TempFileManager class handles temporary files
   - Runs cleanup thread every 1 hour (3600s)
   - Deletes files older than 30 minutes (1800s)
   - Uses UUID for unique filenames

### Technical Implementation Details
- PDF Processing:
  ```python
  # Key parameters for PDF optimization
  doc.save(
      output_path,
      garbage=4,      # Garbage collection level
      deflate=True,   # Stream compression
      clean=True,     # Content cleaning
      pretty=False    # Output formatting
  )
  ```

- Text Highlighting:
  ```python
  # Highlight configuration
  annot = page.add_highlight_annot(inst)
  annot.set_colors(stroke=(1, 1, 0))  # Yellow highlight
  annot.update()
  ```

- File Management:
  ```python
  # Cleanup configuration
  cleanup_interval = 3600  # 1 hour
  file_lifetime = 1800    # 30 minutes
  ```

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Document Processing
- Multiple fallback strategies for document processing:
  - Attempts PDF parsing first using PyMuPDF/fitz
  - Falls back to text extraction if PDF parsing fails
  - Uses OCR processing for scanned documents
  - Extracts text from images in documents when possible
- Robust error handling for various file formats:
  - Validates file extensions and MIME types
  - Handles corrupted PDFs through byte stream validation
  - Manages encoding issues with UTF-8/16/32 detection
  - Preserves document structure during processing
- Graceful degradation for unsupported formats:
  - Returns readable error messages for unsupported files
  - Extracts partial content when full processing fails
  - Maintains metadata even if content extraction fails
  - Logs detailed error information for debugging

### Query Processing
- Token limit management:
  - Monitors total token count per query
  - Truncates long queries to stay within model limits
  - Splits queries if they exceed maximum token length
- Context window optimization:
  - Dynamically adjusts context window size based on query length
  - Prioritizes most relevant context when window is full
  - Implements sliding window approach for long conversations
- Error recovery mechanisms:
  - Retries failed queries with exponential backoff
  - Falls back to smaller context if token limit exceeded
  - Logs errors and query metadata for debugging
  - Provides graceful degradation with partial results

## Performance Considerations

### Token Management
- Dynamic token budgeting: Adjusts token allocation based on available resources by monitoring memory usage and adjusting context window size
- Memory optimization: Implements cleanup of temporary files after 30 minutes (configurable via file_lifetime parameter) and runs cleanup checks hourly
- Context window management: Limits chat history to last 2 messages per session to prevent context overflow while maintaining conversation coherence
### Retrieval Optimization

#### Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)
MMR is an algorithm that helps balance between relevance and diversity in search results. It works by:
- First selecting the most relevant document
- Then iteratively selecting documents that are both relevant to the query and different from already selected documents
- This prevents returning redundant results and ensures coverage of different aspects
Our implementation:
  - Fetches initial k=20 documents
  - Returns top k=5 most relevant yet diverse results
  - Uses lambda_mult=0.7 to balance relevance vs diversity (higher values favor relevance)

#### FlashRank Reranking
FlashRank is a cross-encoder reranking system that:
- Takes the initial retrieval results and performs a second pass of ranking
- Uses a more sophisticated model to analyze query-document pairs
- Can capture nuanced relationships that the initial retrieval might miss
Our usage:
  - Cross-encoder reranking on initial results
  - Improves relevance by considering deeper semantic relationships
  - Reorders results based on contextual similarity scores

#### Contextual Compression
This is a technique to optimize the retrieved passages by:
- Analyzing the semantic importance of different parts of the text
- Removing portions that don't contribute significant information
- Maintaining coherent and informative passages while reducing size
Benefits in our system:
  - Removes redundant or irrelevant content from retrieved passages
  - Preserves key information while reducing token usage
  - Enables fitting more relevant context within token limits
